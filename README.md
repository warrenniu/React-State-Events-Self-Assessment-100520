# Good Drake, Bad Drake

## Deliverables

- You will be given two objects:

   > `{"yes-image": "https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQptvy1IuxkMzOgcsR_uWucIkwE67jI04GfUg&usqp=CAU", "yes-statement": "google the answer"}`
   
   > `{"no-image": "https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ElaborateShinyBernesemountaindog-size_restricted.gif", "no-statement": "learn problem solving, syntax, reading documentation"  }`

- Your goal is to make your app look like the attached wireframe. There should be a statement and underneath that statement is the applicable "yes" or "no" image

- The DOM should first display the `no-image` and `no-statement` an `img` tag and `h1` tag
- When the image is clicked, it should switch to the `yes-image` and `yes-statement`
- When the image is clicked a second time it should flip back

You are given an `App.js` file, an `objects.js` file which exports the two objects mentioned above, and a `state-basic-assessment-wireframe` file which has your wireframe. Use all the tools you have learned to build this app in the way you feel is best. CSS is not mandatory but should be worked on if you have time remaining

## Food for Thought

- Based on the attached wireframe how many components do you think you'll need?
